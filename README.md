# USB Serial Telnet Server
Android application that binds a USB serial converter to a Telnet client

Just connect a USB serial adapter into USB OTG port of your Android device, start this app and connect to it using any Telnet client like
* [JuiceSSH](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sonelli.juicessh) using the same Android device (connect to localhost)
* Telnet client on a computer on the same network (connect over Wi-Fi)

This method allows to use all console features like colors and special keys. So you can easily control/install something like network devices with serial port using only your Android device. Also, you can use it as remote console transmitter.
